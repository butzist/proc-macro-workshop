# Rust Latam: procedural macros workshop

*This repo contains my solution to the Rust procedural macros workshop by David Tolnay*

*Each of these projects is drawn closely from a compelling real use case. Out of
the 5 projects here, 3 are macros that I have personally implemented in
industrial codebases for work, and the other 2 exist as libraries on crates.io
by other authors.*
